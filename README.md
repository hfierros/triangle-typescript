# Triangle-typescript

Example code for Unit Test development. 

## What is this? 

This is a sample code based on triangle (java) that implements the same functionality of triangle. 

## How to use it? 

You need to have nodejs (12+) installed and npm. 

Clone this repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/hfierros/triangle-typescript.git
```

Initialize the repository from npm: 

```
npm i
```

And run the application: 

```
npm run 
```

The structure of the code is an overkill for the application, but will help to show unit test and mocks. 

# TESTING BRANCH

This branch is different from the master becase it has added testing support. 

To run tests: 
```
npm test
```

The file `jest.config.js` has been configured to check coverage, and generate a coverage report. 
The report is stored on direcory `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
